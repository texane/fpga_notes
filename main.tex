\begin{abstract}
Set of FPGA related notes, written by a developper still learning
about FPGAs in general, so any feedback welcome. It addresses topics
ranging from coding conventions, verification, synthesis, optimisation,
reusability and documentation. Some notes are vague while others are
quite specific to language, tools or target platforms. Also, it addresses
a wide audience, so some materials may seem obvious to the reader,
depending on her background.

\note{Unconstrained types}
\topics{reusability, documentation, verification}

\paragraph{}
When not explicitly specified by the developer, a type length
is deduced during component instantiation. This favors component
reusability by letting the user decide of the type length
according to its particular needs.

\paragraph{}
For instance, \textit{count} range is unconstrained in the
following component declaration:
\begin{vhdl}
component my_component
port
(
 ...
 count: in unsigned;
 ...
);
\end{vhdl}

\paragraph{}
The actual range is deduced during instantiation:
\begin{vhdl}
signal count: unsigned(7 downto 0);

work.my_component
port map
(
 ...
 count => count
 ...
);
\end{vhdl}

\paragraph{}
One important issue with unconstraint types is that a component
user may inadvertently use types that are larger than required,
possibly leading to unecessary large resource instantiation.
Documentation is a good tool to solve this kind of issue. Also,
assertions can be used to check for degenerate cases:
\begin{vhdl}
component my_component
port
(
 ...
 -- WARNING
 -- hardware comparator infered in subsequent logic
 -- use appropriate length
 count: in unsigned;
 ...
);
end component;
\end{vhdl}

\paragraph{}
If you want to make sure the length fits within a given range,
use assertion in the component entity definition:
\begin{vhdl}
entity my_component
port
(
 ...
 count: in unsigned;
 ...
);
end my_component;

architecture my_component_rtl of my_component is
begin
...
assert (count'length <= 16)
report "invalid counter length"
severity failure;
...
end my_component_rtl;
\end{vhdl}

\paragraph{}
Also, avoid using the \textit{others} clause to affect unconstrained
array elements. Some tools will complain (ModelSim vcom). An alternative
is to use the \textit{range} attribute:
\begin{vhdl}
entity my_component
port
(
 ...
 count: in unsigned;
 ...
);
end my_component;

architecture my_component_rtl of my_component is
begin
...
count <= (count'range => '0');
...
end my_component_rtl;
\end{vhdl}

\note{Type attributes}
\paragraph{}
Use type attribute as much as possible, esp. type'length
and type'range

\note{Generics instead of package constants}
\topics{reusability}
\paragraph{}
Often, a component parameter can be set either using package constants
or generics. Using package constants forces the user to modify the package
source code, which is a bad thing considering a package should be reusable
without any modification. On the other hand, generics let the user specializes
the component without modifying any existing source.

\paragraph{}
In the following example, the clock frequency (CLK\_FREQ) is used by the
component called slave. The frequency could be defined as a constant in the
package, like this:
\begin{vhdl}
package abs_enc_pkg is
...
constant CLK_FREQ: integer := 12500000;
...
component slave
port
(
 clk: in std_logic;
 rst: in std_logic;
 ...
);
end component;
...
end package abs_enc_pkg;
\end{vhdl}

\paragraph{}
A user wanting to change CLK\_FREQ the clock frequency must change the
abs\_enc\_pkg source file. This can be avoided by defining CLK\_FREQ as
a component generic:
\pagebreak
\begin{vhdl}
package abs_enc_pkg is
component slave
generic
(
 CLK_FREQ: integer := 12500000;
);
port
(
 clk: in std_logic;
 rst: in std_logic;
 ...
);
end component;
...
end package abs_enc_pkg;
\end{vhdl}

\paragraph{}
Since the CLK\_FREQ is not globally visible, it must be propagated
through the design hierarchy. This might be inconvenient as the generics
lists grow larger, but a clear advantage for reusability.

\todo
{
 Global variables may be used to solve this issue,
 but I do not think their use is encouraged.
}

\note{Per component test benches}
\topics{simulation}
\paragraph{}
Per component test benches generally requires less code than
project wide ones. It makes them easier to maintain, and
encourages the developer to write self contained components.
Also, it makes simulation run faster.

\note{Hardware resource inference}
\topics{synthesis}
\paragraph{}
Usually, a VHDL developer does not explicitely indicate what
hardware resource to use to implement logic. The synthetiser
deduces that from its source code understanding (ie. signal
netlist and operations). This process is known as inference.
\paragraph{}
Inference is very sensitive to the way code is written. For
instance, the use of an additional signal to reset a shift
register may prevent the synthetiser to infer a hardware
shift register.
\paragraph{}
Thus, VHDL developers try as much as possible to write code
in a standard way, that is known to be well understood by the
synthetiser.

\note{Test benches as documentation}
\topics{documentation}

\paragraph{}
A component developer should consider test benches an important
part of the documentation since they are used as reference
materials by the component user. Thus, test benches should be up
to date, clearly written and well documented. If possible, they
should cover different use cases, without flooding the user with
unrequired contents.


%%
\note{Writing synchronous processes}
\topics{synthesis}

\paragraph{}
There is one standard way of writing synchronous process:
\begin{vhdl}
process(clk, rst)
begin
 if rising_edge(clk) then
  if rst = '1' then
  else
  end if;
 end if;
end process;
\end{vhdl}

\paragraph{}
Another way which is synthetizable:
\begin{vhdl}
process
begin
 wait until rising_edge(clk);

 if rst = '1' then
 end if;

end process;
\end{vhdl}

\paragraph{}
Since the \textbf{wait} statement must come first, all the signal
are synchronous, esp. the reset. Also, this convention results in
a somewhat clearer code.


%%
\note{Clocking}

\todo{wip}
\paragraph{}
Clear convention about how data passed to/from a component are
clocked. by default, clocked using the component domain. idem for
latching.


%%
\note{Appropriate typing}
\topics{verification, documentation}

\paragraph{}
Use the most specialized types (unsigned, boolean ...) and sizes
early in the design hierarchy. It avoids further casting and
simplifies the code. It acts as documentation since the reader
deduces information from the type itself. For instance, an
unsigned counter tells it can not be negative. Typing also
improve static time checks.


%%
\note{Component directory structure}
\topics{reusability, documentation}

\paragraph{}
Having a clear, self contained directory structure is helpful
for both the user and the developer. I opted for the following
one, that simple but fits most of the cases:
\begin{sh}
my_component/
 src/
  my_component_pkg.vhd
  my_component_rtl.vhd
  ...
 sim/
  common/
   main_tb.vhd
  isim/
   isim.tcl
   isim.prj
   isim.sh
  modelsim/
   ...
 syn/
  ise/
   xc7k325t.ucf
   xc7vx485t.ucf
  vivado/
   ...
 doc/
  my_component.pdf
\end{sh}

\paragraph{}
Providing synthesis files allows the user to synthetise the
component for a given platform. It should not synthetise a full
working design, only the bare minimum so the user can check its
toolchain (esp. version), and investigate what hardware resources
are infered.

\note{Modular simulation}
\topics{reusability, simulation}
\todo{add composed simulation scenarios}

\paragraph{}
Generally, a simulation is implemented as a single monolitic file. Signals
are commented based on what the user wants to investigate. This approach is
unconvenient at least, especially when signals are mutually exclusive.
\paragraph{}
Another approach is to split the simulation into multiple scripts. A modular
environment favors new scenario composition by aggregating existing scripts.
Also, it makes it easier for a user toinvestigate only the signals he is
interested in. Also, it makes the environment easier for the developper to
maintain anad reuse.

\paragraph{}
For instance, a project implementing a generic serial link controller may use
the following structure for an ISIM simulation:
\begin{sh}
generic_serial_controller/
 ...
 sim/
  common/
   main.vhd
  isim/
   i2c.tcl
   spi.tcl
   onewire.tcl
   common.tcl
   main.tcl
 ...
\end{sh}

\paragraph{}
In this example, the main file is in charge of sourcing other files
and running the simulation:
\pagebreak
\begin{tcl}
source common.tcl

if { [ file exists user.tcl ] == 1 } {
 source user.tcl
} else {
 source i2c.tcl
 source spi.tcl
 source onewire.tcl
}

run 150 us
\end{tcl}

\paragraph{}
The file common.tcl adds the signals that will be required in any simulation.
What signal is required is left as a decision to the developper. In this
example, both system clock, reset and serial link clock and data are added:
\begin{tcl}
isim force add {/main/clk} \
 1 -value 0 -radix bin -time 10 ns -repeat 20 ns

isim force add {/main/rst} \
 1 -value 0 -time 2 us

wave add /main/master_clock
wave add /main/master_data
wave add /main/slave_data
\end{tcl}

\paragraph{}
The other files add protocol specific signal. For instance, spi.tcl:
\begin{tcl}
wave add /main/master/gen_spi/master_spi/curr_state
wave add /main/master/gen_spi/master_spi/spi_clk
wave add /main/master/gen_spi/master_spi/spi_miso
wave add /main/master/gen_spi/master_spi/spi_mosi
\end{tcl}

\paragraph{}
Finally, a user specific file is included if it exists. It may contain
whatever signal is of interest to the user. With this approach, there
is no need for the user to modify existing files.
